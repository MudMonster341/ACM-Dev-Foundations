> “If you have a Python app, PythonAnywhere makes deployment as simple as a few clicks.”

We’ll walk you through what PythonAnywhere is and how you can use it to host your Python web applications online.

## What is PythonAnywhere?

PythonAnywhere is a cloud hosting service specifically designed for running Python applications.

It allows you to deploy web apps without needing to worry about server management or configuration. Plus, it has a free tier, which is perfect for beginners and small projects.

## Why Use PythonAnywhere?

* **Easy to use:** You don’t need to manage servers or install software manually.
* **Accessible:** It provides a browser-based interface for working with your code.
* **Free tier:** Perfect for hobby projects or simple web apps to get you started.

### Key Features:
1. **Web hosting:** PythonAnywhere allows you to run web apps using frameworks like Flask, Django, or even simple WSGI applications.
2. **Python environment:** You get a complete Python environment with access to libraries, frameworks, and virtual environments.
3. **Shell access:** PythonAnywhere provides an online shell, so you can run terminal commands directly from your browser.
4. **Database hosting:** You can also create and manage databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) for your web apps.


## How Does It Work?

PythonAnywhere provides you with access to a virtual machine running on the cloud. You can use this machine to host your Python apps, run scripts, and manage your databases.

## Deploying your Python Web App on PythonAnywhere

1. **Sign up**: First, go to PythonAnywhere and create a free account.

2. **Upload your code**: After signing in, you can upload your Python app files directly via the web interface, or you can pull them from a version control system like GitHub. We'll be taking the second approach.

3. **Set up a web app:**
* Go to the Web tab in PythonAnywhere’s dashboard.
* Select Add a new web app.
* Choose your Python version and framework (Flask, Django, etc.).
* Set the path to your app files.

4. **Configure the WSGI file**:
* PythonAnywhere uses WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) to serve Python apps.
* You’ll need to edit the WSGI configuration file to point to your Python app’s entry point (usually the file where app = Flask(__name__) is defined in Flask, or wsgi.py in Django).

5. **Run your app:** Once everything is set up, you can click Reload to deploy your app. It will be accessible via a web link provided by PythonAnywhere, something like {{yourusername}}.pythonanywhere.com
